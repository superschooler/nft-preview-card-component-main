## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

The biggest learning point for me on this project was creating the hover effect on the image _with_ the eye icon in the middle. After struggling for a bit, I ended up watching a YouTube video that was a tremendous help and even allowed me to add a smooth transition!

### Continued development

As I begin working on more lengthy projects, I'd like to take more time reading through MDN documentation and playing with different things. For now, I'm trying to move through the easier projects quickly with little external resources.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks - A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - My favorite resource on Flexbox, this site always helps me remember the difference between align and justify.
- [YouTube - dcode's Image Hover Text Overlay Effect with HTML & CSS Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exb2ab72Xhs) - This video helped me tremendously with the image hover effect, centering the view icon, and adding a nice transition.
